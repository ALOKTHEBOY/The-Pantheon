## Current Sprint
Sprint 7: Product Catalog & Dynamic Filtering

## Completed
- Environment setup & Vite installation
- Built base application shell and folder architecture
- Created design tokens and global reset
- Extracted Header, Footer, and Layout components
- Built responsive grid and flexbox utilities
- Built dynamic navigation menu in Header
- Implemented currency formatting utility
- Created dummy product data
- Built reusable ProductCard component and mapped data to grid
- Built a hash-based client-side router in main.js
- Rendered full product catalog and filter UI in Products page

## Decisions
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules, Vite)
- UI Components are standard functions returning HTML string literals
- Centralized UI assembly in a Layout wrapper
- Single Page Application (SPA) architecture using hash routing (`window.location.hash`)

## Next Task
- Implement JavaScript logic for dynamic category filtering
